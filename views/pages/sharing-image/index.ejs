        <h1>Sharing Image</h1>

        <p>
            Sharing Image is a <strong>WordPress plugin</strong> for generating sharing posters in social networks.
            Allows you to use text, watermarks and various filters.
            It is possible to create different posters for any posts types, archives and taxonomies.
            Compatible with various SEO plugins.
        </p>

        <p>
            Custom posters draw attention to your social media links and make them stand out from the rest in your feed.
            You can also place your company logo as a watermark to increase your brand awareness.
            If you are posting video or audio, it can be a good idea to add a play icon to your poster to help users identify the type of content.
        </p>

        <p>
            Just search <code>sharing-image</code> and activate the plugin from your admin dashboard.
            You can also manually upload the <a href="https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/sharing-image.zip"
                target="_blank">latest release</a>
            to <code>/wp-content/plugins</code> and activate it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The standard <strong>PHP GD</strong> library is used to generate posters. Its presence is mandatory in the system.
            If you are unable to install it yourself, contact your hoster or system administrator.

        </h2>

        <p>
            Plugin usage is divided into 2 stages: template preparation and poster generation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Navigate to the <strong>Sharing Image Settings</strong> first.
            Add new template and fill desired options.
            You can upload permanent background for the template or select it for each post on poster generate stage.
            Poster <strong>width and height apply to all templates</strong>. Default values preferred.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now you can add layers to the template.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Text layer. </strong>
                The text can be static for all posters of this template, or set manually for each post.
                The starting position and the size of the text block are set relative to the size of the entire template.
                You can also upload your own font or choose from the suggested.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Image layer.</strong>
                You can also add a static image to your poster, such as a logo or watermark.
                Set its size and location.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Filter layer.</strong>
                Experiment with the filter layer to make the poster text readable.
                Note that the order of the layers matters — the filter can only be applied to the background or to a ready-made poster.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Rectangle layer.</strong>
                You can use it to draw a boundary line or frame the text you want.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            On the <strong>Configuration tab</strong> you can select the poster image format,
            the download directory and the default poster — it will be used for all pages where there is no generated.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the post page, you can generate a poster.
            If <strong>Premium</strong> is available to you, then first you need to choose one of the available templates.
            Taxonomy posters are also availible for <strong>Premium</strong> users.
        </p>

        <p>
            Load the background and enter text if necessary, then generate a poster and save the post.
            All is ready!
        </p>

        <p>
            By default, posters are displayed in the page meta tags for all posts,
            if you want to manage this yourself, you can disable the meta display using <code>sharing_image_hide_meta</code> <a href="/sharing-image/hooks/#sharing_image_hide_meta">filter</a>.
            To display the poster manually, use the <code>sharing_image_poster()</code> or <code>sharing_image_poster_src()</code> functions.

            The plugin has great extensibility. Most of the main methods return WordPress hooks, and you can change them as you wish.
            Write your own plugin or use your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file.
