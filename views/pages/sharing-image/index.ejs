        <h1>Sharing Image</h1>

        <p>
            Sharing Image is a <strong>Wordpress plugin</strong> for generating sharing posters in social networks.
            Allows you to use text, watermarks and various filters.
            It is possible to create different posters for any posts types, archives and taxonomies.
            Compatible with various SEO plugins.
        </p>

        <p>
            Custom posters draw attention to your social media links and make them stand out from the rest in your feed.
            You can also place your company logo as a watermark to increase your brand awareness.
            If you are posting video or audio, it can be a good idea to add a play icon to your poster to help users identify the type of content.

        <p>
            Just search <code>sharing-image</code> and activate the plugin from your admin dashboard.
            You can also manually upload the <a href="https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/sharing-image.zip"
                target="_blank">latest release</a>
            to <code>/wp-content/plugins</code> and activate it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The standard <strong>PHP GD</strong> library is used to generate posters. Its presence is mandatory in the system.
            If you are unable to install it yourself, contact your hoster or system administrator.

        <p>
            Plugin usage is divided into 2 stages: template preparation and poster generation.

        </p>

        <p>
            Pay attention to the <strong>Subtitle</strong> optional field on each provider.
            Fill it out if you want to use several accounts of the same social network or just for your convenience when
            scheduling.
        </p>

        <p>
            Read the detailed <a href="/social-planner/setup/">configuration guide</a> for each social network on a separate page.

        <p>
            The plugin has great extensibility. Most of the main methods return WordPress hooks, and you can change them as you wish.
            Write your own plugin or use your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file.
